Space Efficient Evaluation of Answer Set Programs with Bounded Predicate Arities

This is the implementation of the evaluation method for Answer Set Programs with Bounded Predicate Arities as described in our publication:

[Space Efficient Evaluation of ASP Programs with Bounded Predicate Arities. T Eiter, W Faber, M Mushthofa - AAAI, 2010](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mushthofa_Mushthofa/publication/221603214_Space_Efficient_Evaluation_of_ASP_Programs_with_Bounded_Predicate_Arities/links/0f31753a8120acfdeb000000.pdf)
and my thesis: 
Evaluation of Answer Set Programs with Bounded Predicate Arities. TU Wien. 2009.

You will need to use Boost Library and install DLV and XSB Prolog in order to use the functionality of ASBPA.
